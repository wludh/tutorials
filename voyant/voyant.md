# Voyant Tutorial

Voyant Tools is "a web-based reading and analysis environment for digital texts." You can upload a text, then use one of its many analysis and visualization tools to uncover statistics about your texts.

Voyant comes with [extensive documentation and tutorials](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/start), but below you'll find a few tips and tricks.

## Text Preparation

Voyant accepts a variety of file formats, but it can be helpful to store your texts in plain text format (.txt). You can do this is Word, or other text editors like Notepad, Text Edit, or software for writing code like Visual Studio Code. The plain text format strips formatting since text analysis relies on the words in a document, not how it looks.

If you find the text you're using seems messy, programs like [Lexos](http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/) have tools for processing and cleaning your text. Things like capitalization, punctuation, and line breaks can have an affect on your analysis.

Finally, it's helpful to give your files meaningful names, since Voyant uses those filenames in its visualizations. If you have texts from different years and you want to sort them chronologically, consider putting the year at the beginning of the filename. 

## Uploading Texts

In addition to the initial interface, you can add additional texts by visiting the **Document** tab (usually in the bottom left corner). From there, click **Modify** then **Add** to upload more files. They should appear the way that the Austen and Shakespeare demos do.

## Visualization Tips

* There are a lot of visualizations! When you hover near the question mark in any window, you should see a menu pop up. The window icon takes you to an extensive menu of visualization options. 
* You can even change the organization of the windows by applying a [skin](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/skins) to your corpus.
